Intersector.

Intersector goal is to find maximized subset of non-intersecting figures build on given points in reasonable time.
Way it should work:
1. Generate set of points.
2. Choose type of figures being connected with points.
3. Run calculation.
4. Get a subset of non-intersecting figures, where each has center in one of generated points.
